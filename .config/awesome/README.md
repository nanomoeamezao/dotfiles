Awesome is a highly configurable, next generation framework window manager for X.

# Features

* Simple, small and extensible. It's easy to write your own layouts,
  widgets and commands.
* Configured in Python.
* Command shell that allows all aspects of Qtile to be managed and
  inspected.
* Complete remote scriptability - write scripts to set up workspaces,
  manipulate windows, update status bar widgets and more.
* Qtile's remote scriptability makes it one of the most thoroughly
  unit-tested window managers around.
